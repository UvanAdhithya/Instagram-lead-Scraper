========== How to RUN ==========

1. Double click the .exe file, wait until a new chrome browser pops up
2. Go back to terminal, follow prompts
3. After the prompts go to Instagram in the newly opened chrome browser and click on Search icon on the left
4. The tool will begin scraping in the background. DO NOT close the terminal

========== NOTES ==========
1. Scraping too much may trigger IG security resulting in account suspension.
2. If any error occurs eg: TimeOut; try again using a new username and password
3. DO NOT OPEN Excel file while script is running. Will corrupt the spreadsheet
4. "login_details.pkl" is created and stores login credentials
5. The gibberish in the "Bio" field are non convertible utf-8 coded emojis. So no important data is lost
